# JaffaJS Version 0.2 alpha 

#### JaffaJS is a (m)VC framework for phonegap apps I built a while ago, really before the likes of angular or backbone were an option. 

This uses JQUERY as a core and is really for: 

1. Users who would like only to jQuery as their library.
2. Users who would like to hook into phonegaps localstorage and database storage libs in an easy way.

Jaffa should sit in the phonegap www/ folder.

forgive the rough edges, im trying to tidy it up as I get more spare time.

This framework should be available using the GPU and MIT licences.
