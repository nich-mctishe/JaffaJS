		<h1>Controllers</h1>
		<p>Controllers are objects that handle all the requests that are being made. Be that requests for a new page, requests to the server, or simple population of a field, the controller will either either perform the request itself or use one of the many helper objects to complete the task for it.</p>
		<p>Ideally Controllers should be split along each main operation. For example this Application has three controllers.</p>
		<ul role="bullet-list">
			<li>initial controller - each application will need a controller to begin performing functions on page load.</li>
			<li>form controller - to handle to saving and displaying of the data on the form</li>
			<li>manual controller - to assist with the displaying of the manual</li>
		</ul>
		<p>to save on code many pages will not need a controller to function. a static page in JaffaJS will spawn using only the <a href="#manual/loader.html">Loader.</a></p>
		<p>each controller will need to the following code:</p>
		<code>
			var myController = {
				onDeviceReady: function()
				{
					//code goes here to be called when the controller is first loaded
				},
				controllerIcons: function(){
					//this is where you should place all the calls to external 'pages' in this script so that their onDeviceReady functions will run.
				}
			}
		</code>
		<p>All controllers are placed in the folder js/controllers/ and will need to be called from the index.html page inside <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags</p>
		<p>please remember that all controller object need unique name, but the same controller can be called many times.</p>
